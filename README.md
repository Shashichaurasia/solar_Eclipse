# solar_Eclipse
Immerse yourself in the cosmic dance of celestial bodies with this interactive solar eclipse simulation. Using HTML and CSS, I have brought to life the captivating movements of the Earth, Moon, Sun, and even Mars as they gracefully orbit and rotate in a mesmerizing cosmic ballet.
This project aims to blend education and entertainment, providing a visually stunning and informative experience of the celestial mechanics governing our solar system.
